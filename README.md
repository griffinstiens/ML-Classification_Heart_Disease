# ML-Classification_Heart_Disease


# An end-to-end heart disease classification workflow
This notebook implements some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the problem of heart disease **classification**.

The goal of this is to mimic what a data scientist or machine learning engineer would produce as **proof of concept**.

## What is Classification?
Classification involes deciding whether a sample is part of one class or antoher (single-class classification). If there are multiple class options, it's referred to as **multi-class classification**.

## Implemented concepts
* **Exploratory Data Analysis** 
* **Model Training**
* **Model Evaluation**
* **Model Comparison** 
* **Model fine-tuning**
* **Feature Importance**
* **Cross-Validation**
* **Evaluating and Reporting Results**
